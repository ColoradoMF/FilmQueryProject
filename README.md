# 🎬 Film Query App

## Overview

Film Query App is a command-line Java application that connects to a MySQL database (`sdvid`) to allow users to search and explore information about films. Users can look up a film by its ID or search for films using keywords found in the title or description.

All database interaction is handled through JDBC and encapsulated in a well-structured DAO pattern.
